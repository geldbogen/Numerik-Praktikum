The two figures in this folder show the relationship of the parameter lambda
to the amount of iterations needed, to approximate the solution up to an error of 10^-4.
Figure 1 has a normal scale, Figure 2 a logarithmical one.
The starting point was always the zero vector in R^10.
Because not all algorithms terminated there was a cutoff at 200 iterations introduced.
